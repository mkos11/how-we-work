JTology - How We Work
===========

## Values & Core Principles

* Fairness
* Joy
* [Kaizen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kaizen)

## Other Guides:

* [For Product Owners](product.md)
* [Thoughtbot's Guides](https://github.com/thoughtbot/guides)

## Base Strucutring Projects

* SCSS: Structure is based on [RSCSS](https://github.com/rstacruz/rscss)
* Vanila JavaScript: Strucutre is based on [RSJS](https://github.com/rstacruz/rsjs)
* Other common structure of JavaScript Page logic: https://github.com/tastejs/todomvc/blob/gh-pages/examples/jquery/js/app.js

## Formatting/Conventions

Base styles guides:

* Ruby - [bbatsov/ruby-style-guide](https://github.com/bbatsov/ruby-style-guide)
* CSS - [JT CSS Style Guide](https://github.com/jetthoughts/how-we-work/blob/master/css.md)
* JavaScript - [airbnb/javascript](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript)

Our updates:

* Limit lines to 110 characters, in order to remove horizontal scrolling on the GitHub when we are doing code review
* Align parameters like:

```ruby
# good (normal indent) PREFERABLE
def send_mail(source)
  Mailer.deliver(
    to: 'bob@example.com',
    from: 'us@example.com',
    subject: 'Important message',
    body: source.text
  )
end

# not so bad
def send_mail(source)
  Mailer.deliver(
    to: 'bob@example.com', from: 'us@example.com'
  )
end

# good, but DEPRECATED
def send_mail(source)
  Mailer.deliver(to: 'bob@example.com',
                 from: 'us@example.com',
                 subject: 'Important message',
                 body: source.text)
end
```
* Use prefix `_` for memo variables:
 
```ruby
class TestObject
  attr_reader :attr_name
  
  def attr_name
    @attr_name ||= lazy_calculation_for_attr_name
  end
  
  def public_method_with_memo
    @_public_method_with_memo ||= public_method_with_memo_calculcations
  end
end
```

* Stick to [Newlines](https://github.com/airbnb/ruby#newlines) section of Airbnb's Ruby style guide for grouping the code within methods.

## Working with Bugs

* Confirm on the master, the staging and finally on development environment. 
* Add tests with reproduced bugs before add fixes

## Ruby on Rails Conventions

* We use Decorators (in code we called them `Carrier`) as View and Form objects: [introduction how to use them](https://goo.gl/photos/nN1yNNqUoyKEK6an7)
* We do not use full Presenters (TODO: add link to first post about them) with any tag generations
* We do not overuse of [Concerns](https://blog.codeship.com/when-to-be-concerned-about-concerns/)
* <a name="prevent-syntax-sugar-overuse"></a>We do not overuse (in 99% of our code we do not see such stuff): `send`, `&.`, `**`. To prevent misusage of Ruby Syntax Sugars <sup>[[link](#prevent-syntax-sugar-overuse)]</sup>

## Test Conventions

### Principles

* TDD
* Clarity means that a test should serve as readable documentation for humans, describing the code being tested in terms of its public APIs. 
* A test is complete when its body contains all of the information you need to understand it, and concise when it doesn't contain any other distracting information.

Ref: [Testing on the Toilet: What Makes a Good Test?](https://testing.googleblog.com/2014/03/testing-on-toilet-what-makes-good-test.html)

### Rules

* <a name="tdd-tests"></a>Tests First<sup>[[link](#tdd-tests)]</sup>
  * <a name="black-box-tests"></a>Use Black Box testing strategy (there is no other way to support TDD)<sup>[[link](#black-box-tests)]</sup>

    By ignoring the code (Black box testing), it demonstrates a different value system - the tests are valuable alone.
* <a name="meaningful-names-in-tests"></a>We use the meaningful names in the test cases. It makes easier to understand the business logic.<sup>[[link](#meaningful-names-in-tests)]</sup>

```ruby
# bad
def test_email_is_normalized
  user = User.create! email: 'Foo@quux.com'
  assert_equal 'foo@quux.com', user.email
end

# good
def test_email_is_normalized
  user = User.create! email: ' thisIsAMixedCaseEmail@example.com'
  assert_equal 'thisisamixedcaseemail@example.com', user.email
end
```
* <a name="big-fixtures-in-tests"></a>The test is building or referencing a larger fixture than is needed to verify the functionality in question. Do not load more data than needed to test your code. For each test create exactly what it needs and not more. More variations provides more complexities. More details could be found on http://xunitpatterns.com/Obscure%20Test.html#General%20Fixture <sup>[[link](#big-fixtures-in-tests)]</sup>

  Message for reviewer: 

  > Each check must be isolated and shouldn't depend or interfere with others. This will make your tests clear and well organized and help to clearly see the cause of the failure. Please check https://github.com/jetthoughts/how-we-work/blob/master/README.md#big-fixtures-in-tests

```ruby
# BAD
let!(:user_with_big_name) { ... }
let!(:user_with_small_name) { ... }

it 'this test use only user_with_big_name' { expects(response).to have(user_with_big_name) }
it 'this test use only user_with_small_name' { expects(response).to have(user_with_small_name) }
```

```ruby
# GOOD
context 'with big name' do
  let(:user) { ... }
  
  it 'this test use only user_with_big_name' { expects(response).to have(user) }
end

context 'with small name' do
  let(:user) { ... }
  
  it 'this test use only user_with_small_name' { expects(response).to have(user) }
end
```

```ruby
# BAD

  big_file_with_all_users = compile_file_from_users(User.all)
end

test 'this test use only user_with_big_name' { assert_includes big_file_with_all_users, 'magic string with all big letter' }
test 'this test use only user_with_small_name' { assert_includes big_file_with_all_users, 'magic string with all small letter' }
```

```ruby
# GOOD
test 'this test use only user_with_big_name' do
  result = compile_file_from_users(User.new(name: 'Big Name'))
  assert_includes result, 'Big Name'
end

test 'this test use only user_with_small_name' do
  result = compile_file_from_users(User.new(name: 'Samll Name'))
  assert_includes result, 'Small Name'
end
```

* <a name="dynamic-cases-in-tests"></a>No Dynamic Test generation.<sup>[[link](#dynamic-cases-in-tests)]</sup>

```ruby
# BAD
{ string: 'zone_id', array: %w[zone_id], hash: { "0" => "zone_id" } }.each do |type, group_by|
  it "returns valid json if group_by is #{type}" do
  end
end
```

```ruby
# GOOD
it "returns zone_id json if group_by is string" { }
it "returns [zone_id] json if group_by is array" { }
it "returns { '0' => 'zone_id' } json if group_by is hash" { }
```
* <a name="irrelevant-information"></a>Irrelevant Information<sup>[[link](#irrelevant-information)]</sup>

  Message for reviewer:

  > The test is exposing a lot of irrelevant details about the fixture that distract the test reader from what really affects the behavior of the subject under test.


```ruby
describe 'PUT Update' do
  let!(:user) { create :user }

  # Bad
  it 'updates user' do
    attributes = { first_name: '..', last_name: '..', role: '..', email: '..' }
    put: :update, params: { attributes }
    expects(response.body).to eq attributes
  end

  # Good
  it 'updates first_name' do
    put: :update, params: { first_name: 'John Dou' }
    expects(response.body).to have_attribute { first_name: 'John Dou' }
  end

  it 'updates email' do
    put: :update, params: { email: 'email@example.com' }
    expects(response.body).to have_attribute { email: 'email@example.com' }
  end
```

## Setup Development Environment

* `bin/setup` - cold setup
* `bin/update` - update environment on new code updates

## Delivery Flow

Our flow is based on GitHub flow with Heroku Review

* create PR (we convert issues into PR)
* deploy PR to Heroku (we use Heroku Review to do this automatically)
* verify on Heroku yourselves
* ask verify, to code review and to merge (we have Code Review)

## TODO/FIXME Notes

* add issue on GitHub per each note
* create TODO/FIXME note in the code
* add in code's note link to GitHub's issue
 
## Git/GitHub

* [Basic git crash course for minimum git commands enough to work on the project](https://jtway.co/how-do-we-git-it-in-jetthoughts-a002b4dba223)
* Prefix feature branch names with issue number: *123-issue-name*;
* Do not mess with cosmetics changes. Move them in separate commit or pr;
* Squash multiple trivial commits into a single commit;
* Convert an existing issue into a pull request: `hub pull-request -i 123`;
* <a name="git-commit-message"></a>Write a good commit message based on http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/ with some requirements<sup>[[link](#git-commit-message)]</sup>:
  ```
  Capitalized, the imperative mood, short (50 chars or less) subject (#<github_id>)
  
  Body after space line. Wrap the body at 72 characters.
  Use the body to explain what and why.
  
  Closes #<other_github_issue_id>, fixes #<another_github_issue_id>
  ```

  * https://github.com/RomuloOliveira/commit-messages-guide
  
* <a name="git-issue-template"></a> Create Issue Template<sup>[[link](#git-issue-template)]</sup>
    * **Title:** Jobs to be done
    * **Body:**
    
      *1. Acceptance Criteria*
      
      Acceptance criteria is that a developer knows they need to complete before that issue can be considered 'done'.
      They are the points against which the issue will be tested.

      *2. A screenshot or mock up of a new design*
   
       A picture which illustrates what the issue should be creating or a screenshot of an existing page showing where a bug is occurring.
       Remember to include mock ups of both mobile and desktop views.
